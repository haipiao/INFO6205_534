# INFO6205_534 README

To implement the genetic algorithm for solving the Knapsack Problem, we implemented 3 Classes: GAK class, test class and th class. 

GAK class mainly focus on defining the DNA and how the DNA structure is translated to goods and the crossover and mutation process. 

The th class mainly focus on the parallel computation mechanism that we can be divide the population up into colonies and create the next generations for each colony in parallel. 

The test class is used to test the running of the algorithm.
